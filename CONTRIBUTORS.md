# Contributors — Bank-With-High-Functionalities

The Bank-With-High-Functionalities project exists and evolves through the dedication, expertise, and generosity of its contributors. Every improvement — whether architectural refinement, feature development, testing, documentation, design, or maintenance — represents a meaningful investment of time and knowledge into the project’s growth.

This document formally recognizes and attributes all individuals who have contributed to the repository. The project maintains a transparent and permanent record of contributors to acknowledge effort, preserve authorship history, and uphold open-source attribution standards.

---

## Recognition Philosophy

Open source thrives on collaboration. Contributions of all scales are valued — from foundational architecture to incremental fixes. Attribution is provided uniformly to ensure fairness, consistency, and respect across the contributor community.

All listed individuals are recognized equally within the project’s history regardless of contribution type, frequency, or scope. Roles such as maintainer, reviewer, author, or contributor are intentionally not distinguished here, as the purpose of this document is attribution rather than hierarchy.

---

## Inclusion Criteria

A contributor is included in this document if they have made a meaningful contribution to the repository through one or more of the following:

- Code contributions  
- Documentation improvements  
- Issue reporting with actionable detail  
- Testing or validation  
- Design or structural input  
- Maintenance or refactoring  
- Project infrastructure updates  

Contributions may originate from commits, pull requests, reviews, or other accepted project changes.

---

## Ordering Policy

Contributors are listed in chronological order of their **first accepted contribution** to the repository. Earlier contributors appear first, and the most recent contributors appear last. This ordering reflects the historical evolution of the project.

The list is intentionally **not sorted alphabetically** to preserve contribution timeline integrity.

---

## Identity Representation

Each contributor is represented by their public GitHub identity:

- Profile avatar only (username shown as tooltip on hover)

Avatars provide quick visual recognition, and the contributor’s GitHub username is displayed as a tooltip on hover to ensure precise attribution and traceability while maintaining a uniform grid layout.

---

## Updating This Document

This file should be updated whenever a new contributor’s work is merged into the project. Maintainers should append new contributors to the **end of the table** to preserve chronological order.

If a contributor changes their GitHub username or profile image, the entry may be updated to reflect the current public identity while preserving attribution continuity.

---

## Attribution Integrity

This contributors list supplements — but does not replace — Git commit history, authorship metadata, or repository insights. The authoritative technical record of contributions remains the version control system.

The purpose of this document is human-readable recognition and acknowledgment.

---

## Acknowledgment

The maintainers express sincere appreciation to every contributor who has invested effort into Bank-With-High-Functionalities. The project’s quality, reliability, and growth are direct outcomes of collaborative contribution.

---

## How to Be Included

Individuals are added to this contributors list after their contribution has been reviewed and accepted into the Bank-With-High-Functionalities repository. Inclusion occurs when a pull request, commit, or other accepted change authored by the contributor becomes part of the project’s version history.

To be recognized in this document, a contributor should:

- Submit a pull request that is merged into the repository, or  
- Have a commit authored by them included in the project, or  
- Provide a documented contribution accepted by maintainers  

Attribution is derived from the Git author identity associated with the accepted contribution. The contributor’s GitHub avatar is used for representation, and the GitHub username is shown as a tooltip on hover to preserve a uniform grid layout.

After a contribution is merged, maintainers will append the contributor to the end of the contributors table in chronological order of first accepted contribution. This preserves the historical sequence of participation in the project.

Contributors who do not yet appear in the list after a merged contribution may open an issue requesting inclusion. The request should reference the accepted contribution (pull request, commit, or change) to ensure accurate attribution.

By contributing to the project, individuals agree to be publicly acknowledged in this contributors record as part of the project’s authorship history.

---

## Username Change Requests

Contributors who have changed their GitHub username may request an update to their attribution entry in this document to reflect their current public identity.

Because contributor avatars are displayed with usernames as hover tooltips, a username change may cause outdated tooltips if not updated in the contributors table. Maintaining accurate identity mapping ensures correct attribution and traceability while preserving the uniform avatar grid.

To request a username update, the contributor should open an issue in the repository with the following information:

- Previous GitHub username (as listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md)  
- Current GitHub username  
- Link to their GitHub profile  
- Reference to at least one past contribution (pull request or commit)  

Maintainers will verify authorship through repository history and update the contributor entry to use the new username while preserving chronological placement in the table.

Username updates do not change contribution order and do not create duplicate entries. The original position in the contributors list is retained to maintain historical accuracy.

## Maintainer Boilerplate — Adding a Contributor

When a new contribution is accepted and merged into the repository, the contributor must be added to the Contributors table to preserve attribution continuity.

Follow the exact structure below when adding a new entry. New contributors must always be appended at the **end of the table**, preserving chronological order of first accepted contribution. Only the contributor avatar is displayed, with the GitHub username shown as a tooltip on hover.

### Contributor Entry Template

```
<td align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/USERNAME" target="_blank" title="@USERNAME">
<img src="https://github.com/USERNAME.png" width="96px" alt="@USERNAME"/>
</a>
</td>
```

### Placement Rules

- Insert into the **last table row** if space exists  
- Otherwise create a **new `<tr>` row at the bottom**  
- Do not reorder existing contributors  
- Do not alphabetize  
- Do not group by role  
- Do not modify earlier entries  

### Example

```
<td align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/octocat" target="_blank" title="@octocat">
<img src="https://github.com/octocat.png" width="96px" alt="@octocat"/>
</a>
</td>
```

Maintaining consistent structure ensures long-term stability and professional presentation of the contributors record.
