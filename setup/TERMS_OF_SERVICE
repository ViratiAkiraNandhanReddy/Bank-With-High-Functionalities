      experimentation, rapid prototyping, load simulation, and operation within 
      highly controlled, non-production deployment environments.
  2.2 Non-Financial Entity: The Software, the Project, and the Author do not 
      constitute, nor do they operate as, a regulated financial institution, a 
      chartered bank, a licensed payment processor, a money transmitter, or a 
      financial intermediary in any jurisdiction globally.
  2.3 Absence of Real-World Financial Utility: Out of the box, the Software does 
      not facilitate real-world banking services, the custody of fiat or 
      cryptocurrency funds, monetary storage, wealth management, or any 
      financial guarantees. If a User chooses to connect the Software to real-
      world financial rails, they do so entirely independently and at their own 
      absolute risk.
  2.4 Contextual Data Value: Any financial interpretation, monetary value 
      representation, or transactional meaning assigned to the data structures, 
      databases, or ledgers within the Software exists solely within the 
      abstract context of the User's specific and isolated deployment environment.

       such damages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. DATA OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY POSTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.1 Localized Data Sovereignty: The Software is architected to store data 
       strictly locally or within the explicit cloud, server, or hardware 
       environments defined and provisioned by the User.
  12.2 No Default Telemetry: Except for the highly specific initialization 
       process detailed meticulously in Section 12A, the Project does not 
       natively collect, transmit, intercept, or scrape User data by default.
  12.3 User Security Imperatives: Users maintain the exclusive and non-
       transferable responsibility for:
       (a) Securing physical and digital storage mediums.
       (b) Managing cryptographic keys and encryption standards.
       (c) Engineering robust authentication and authorization gateways.
       (d) Executing verifiable and redundant backups.
       (e) Maintaining strict legal compliance regarding data residency and 
           privacy.
  12.4 Zero Author Access: The Author possesses zero administrative rights, 
       backdoor access, or visibility into any User's private deployment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12A. SETUP NOTIFICATION TO THE AUTHOR (TELEMETRY DISCLOSURE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  12A.1 Automated Initialization Ping: During the initial installation setup, 
        bootstrap phase, or first-time execution of the Software, a one-time 
        automated notification payload is securely transmitted to the Author.
  12A.2 Mandatory Component: This telemetry ping is engineered as an embedded, 
        mandatory component of the standard Software setup workflow. It is not 
        an optional toggle in the official, unedited distributions of the 
        Project.
  12A.3 Minimalist Metadata Scope: The payload transmitted is strictly limited 
        to non-sensitive, high-level installation metadata. Specifically, it 
        includes only:
        (a) Generalized Geographic Region (e.g., North America, Europe).
        (b) Country of Origin (derived locally or via IP).
        (c) The exact Timestamp of the setup execution.
        (d) The specific Version Number of the Software being deployed.
  12A.4 Strict Exclusion of PII: Absolutely NO personal identifiable information 
        (PII), administrative credentials, financial data, internal IP schemas, 
        or user records are scraped, bundled, or transmitted.
  12A.5 Stated Purpose of Notification: The exclusive purpose of this mechanism 
        is to provide the Author with macro-level visibility into the global 
        reach of the Project. It serves as a psychological and professional 
        incentive to continue dedicating unpaid time to open-source development.
        In the Author's own words:
        "When you install and run my project somewhere in the world, a small 
        note reaches me telling me the region and country. It genuinely 
        motivates me to keep building and improving the Software knowing it is 
        being used globally. This is only about encouragement and awareness -- 
        nothing more."
  12A.6 Operational Limitations of the Ping: The setup notification is highly 
        restricted. It explicitly:
        (a) Does not track, monitor, or log ongoing day-to-day usage or 
            transactions.
        (b) Does not monitor user behavior, keystrokes, or network traffic.
        (c) Does not identify specific individuals, corporations, or hostnames.
        (d) Does not create longitudinal behavioral profiles.
        (e) Does not persist any background telemetry daemons after the initial 
            setup completes.
  12A.7 Informed Consent: By willingly installing, compiling, or executing the 
        Software, the User explicitly acknowledges, understands, and freely 
        consents to this one-time network transmission.
  12A.8 Zero Functional Impact: The success or failure of this notification 
        mechanism has absolutely zero bearing on the core functionality, data 
        processing capabilities, or financial logic of the Software.
  12A.9 Offline Environments: If the Software is deployed in a strictly air-
        gapped or offline network environment, the notification script is 
        designed to fail silently and gracefully without causing application 
        crashes or blocking the setup.
  12A.10 Rights of Derivative Authors: Developers authoring Derivative Works are 
         fully within their rights under the Open Source License to strip, 
         alter, or bypass this notification mechanism in their own distributed 
         forks.
  12A.11 Data Stewardship: The sparse metadata emails received by the Author 
         are treated with respect. They are not sold to data brokers, shared 
         with marketing agencies, published publicly, or utilized for any 
         targeted advertising.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. GOVERNANCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.1 Licensing of Submissions: Any individual contributing code implicitly and 
       explicitly grants rights to their contribution under the exact terms of 
       the Project's repository license (Inbound=Outbound principle).
  13.2 Lawfulness and Originality: All submitted code, documentation, and assets 
       must be strictly lawful and represent the original work of the 
       Contributor, devoid of stolen intellectual property.
  13.3 Affirmation of Rights: Contributors legally affirm and warrant that they 
       possess the unencumbered rights, titles, and permissions necessary to 
       submit the content to the public domain or under the Project's license.
  13.4 Integration into Open Source: Upon acceptance, contributions permanently 
       become part of the collective open-source Project ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. MANAGEMENT OF DERIVATIVE WORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.1 Freedom to Fork: Users are actively encouraged and legally permitted to 
       fork the codebase and create robust Derivative Works.
  14.2 License Compliance: The creation, distribution, and monetization of any 
       Derivative Work must be executed in absolute compliance with the 
       strictures of the foundational Open Source License.
  14.3 Prohibition of Misrepresentation: Modified versions, forks, or derivative 
       platforms must not deceptively misrepresent their origin, nor should they 
       fraudulently claim to be the official "Bank-With-High-Functionalities" 
       release.
  14.4 Severance of Responsibility: The Author bears zero technical, legal, or 
       moral responsibility for bugs, vulnerabilities, or legal infractions 
       introduced by third parties in Derivative Works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.1 Global Availability: The Software is hosted on the public internet and is 
       inherently available to a worldwide audience.
  18.2 Variable Legal Permissibility: The legal permissibility of utilizing 
       banking simulation software, cryptographic libraries, or specific data 
       structures varies wildly from nation to nation.
  18.3 User Affirmation: Users must unilaterally ensure that their access to, 
       and use of, the Software is wholly lawful in their physical location, 
       strictly avoiding deployment in comprehensively sanctioned or embargoed 
       territories where open-source distribution is prohibited by international 
       law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, AND SLAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
