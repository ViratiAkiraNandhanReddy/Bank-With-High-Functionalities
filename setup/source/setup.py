- **Other**: Global variables for GUI state, countdowns, and verification codes.

---

## Utility Functions

### `__timer__(Widget, Count, text_after)`
Implements a countdown timer for a CustomTkinter widget, commonly used for "Resend Code" features.

### `OpenBrowserForSpecifiedUrl(URL)`
Opens a specified URL in the default web browser, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### `Folder_Size(_Path)`
Recursively calculates the total size (in bytes) of all files within a folder.

### `rm_backupbatabasememory()`
Closes all loaded icon images to release memory, especially after backup database operations.

### `register_uninstall_entry_user_scope()`
Registers an uninstall entry for the application in the Windows registry under the current user scope, enabling standard uninstallation via Windows settings.

---

## Backup Management (`CheckForBackupDatabase`)

### Purpose

Handles the detection, validation, restoration, deletion, and organization of up to three backup database folders. Provides a CustomTkinter-based GUI for users to interact with backups, ensuring data integrity and smooth recovery.

### Key Features

- **Detection**: Identifies up to three backup database folders.
- **Corruption Check**: Validates each backup by loading its initialization JSON file.
- **Data Retrieval**: Extracts initialization data and calculates backup size.
- **Graphical Management UI**: Allows preview, restore, and delete actions.
- **Restoration**: Replaces the current database with a selected backup, saving a rollback copy.
- **Deletion**: Removes corrupted or least-used backups.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Deletes the backup with the fewest users or any corrupted backup when creating a new database.
- **Folder Renaming**: Maintains sequential naming after changes.
- **Integration**: Called at startup to manage backup state before setup or normal operation.

### Main Methods

- `Check_Presence_Of_Database()`: Checks for backup folders.
- `Check_For_Corrupted_Databases_And_Retrieve_Data()`: Loads and validates backup data.
- `Restore_Database(Database_Number)`: Restores a selected backup.
- `Restore_Backup_Database_Setup()`: Opens the backup management GUI.
- `Auto_Delete_Database_With_min_Users()`: Deletes the least-used or corrupted backup.
- `Rename_Folders()`: Renames backup folders for sequential order.
- `_exec_func_()`: Handles post-restore/setup actions (shortcuts, uninstall entry).

### Example Usage

```python
backup_checker = CheckForBackupDatabase()
if backup_checker.Check_Presence_Of_Database():
    backup_checker.Restore_Backup_Database_Setup()
```

### Security

- Deletion and restoration are irreversible and require user confirmation.
- Passwords are masked by default in the UI.
- Sensitive data is not exposed in logs or UI unless explicitly requested.

---

## MySQL Connection Testing (`CheckMySQLDatabaseConnection`)

### Purpose

Utility class to verify MySQL server connectivity using credentials provided in `SETUPDATA`. Handles connection attempts and logs errors.

### Main Method

- `DoesServerExists()`: Attempts to connect to the MySQL server and create the required database if it does not exist.

### Example Usage

```python
db_checker = CheckMySQLDatabaseConnection()
if db_checker.DoesServerExists():
    print("MySQL server is accessible.")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to the MySQL server.")
```

### Limitations

- Does not handle advanced MySQL configurations (SSL, plugins).
- Only returns a boolean for success/failure.

---

## Email Verification (`Manager_Email_Verification`)

### Purpose

Handles the manager's email verification process during setup. Generates a unique verification code, sends it via email, and provides resend functionality.

### Key Features

- **Verification Code Generation**: Secure, random code with expiration.
- **HTML Email Template**: Responsive and branded.
- **SMTP Sending**: Uses app password for secure authentication.
- **Resend Support**: Allows resending the code if needed.
- **GUI Integration**: Displays status and errors in the setup wizard.

### Main Methods

- `__init__(ReceiverMailAddress)`: Initializes with the manager's email.
- `Send_Gmail()`: Sends the verification email.
- `Resend_Gmail()`: Resends the verification email.

### Example Usage

```python
email_verification = Manager_Email_Verification(ReceiverMailAddress="manager@example.com")
result = email_verification.Send_Gmail()
print(result)
email_verification.Resend_Gmail()
```

### Security

- App password is used only for SMTP authentication and not stored in plaintext.
- Verification code expires after 10 minutes.

---

## Setup Wizard (`Setup`)

### Purpose

Implements the main setup wizard as a multi-step GUI using CustomTkinter. Guides the user through all required steps for installation and configuration.

### Key Features

- **Welcome Screen**: Greeting and start button.
- **Terms and Conditions**: License agreement acceptance.
- **Software Activation**: Product key validation.
- **Manager Mode Setup**: Collects and validates manager credentials.
- **Email Verification**: Sends and validates verification code.
- **Database Selection**: SQLite3, MySQL, or JSON.
- **MySQL Setup**: Collects and tests MySQL credentials.
- **Final Review**: Displays all collected data for confirmation.
- **Finish Setup**: Handles post-setup actions (shortcuts, notifications).

### Main Methods

- `__init__()`: Initializes the setup class.
- `__str__()`: Returns contribution and repository info.
- `SetupWindows()`: Manages the entire setup process and GUI navigation.
- `Inject_Initialization_Data_Into_JSON_Files()`: Saves setup data to JSON files.

### Example Usage

```python
setup = Setup()
setup.SetupWindows()
```

### Security

- Sensitive data is stored only in local JSON files.
- All registry and file operations are performed under the current user scope.
- Email credentials are not exposed in logs or messages.

---

## Cleanup Handler (`__atexit__`)

### Purpose

Ensures all open log files are properly closed when the program exits, preventing data loss or file corruption.

### Example Usage

```python
import atexit
atexit.register(__atexit__)
```

---

## Main Entry Point

The module is intended to be run as the main entry point of the application (typically as a PyInstaller EXE). On launch, it will:

1. Check for existing backup databases and prompt the user to restore or delete them if found.
2. If no backups are present or after restoration, launch the setup wizard for new installations.
3. Guide the user through all required steps, saving configuration and creating necessary system entries.
4. Handle all errors gracefully and log them for troubleshooting.

### Example

```python
Backup_Database_cls = CheckForBackupDatabase()
isDatabasesAvailable = Backup_Database_cls.Check_Presence_Of_Database()

if isDatabasesAvailable:
    Backup_Database_cls.Restore_Backup_Database_Setup()
    if Backup_Database_cls.isNewDatabaseRequested:
        Backup_Database_cls.Auto_Delete_Database_With_min_Users()
        rm_backupbatabasememory()
        Setup().SetupWindows()
    else:
        Backup_Database_cls._exec_func_()
    Backup_Database_cls.Rename_Folders()
else:
    rm_backupbatabasememory()
    Setup().SetupWindows()
```

---

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data (passwords, security codes) is stored only locally and never transmitted except for email verification.
- Registry and file operations are performed under the current user scope.
- Deletion and restoration of backups are irreversible and require user confirmation.
- Email credentials are used only for SMTP authentication and are not exposed in logs or messages.

---

## Error Handling

- All critical operations (file, network, registry) are wrapped in try/except blocks.
- Errors are logged to dedicated log files (`ErrorLogs.txt`, `EmailLogs.txt`, `SetupLogs.txt`).
- The application provides user-friendly error messages and guidance in the GUI.

---

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Full support, including registry and shortcut creation.
- **Other OS**: Some features (shortcuts, registry) may not be available or will be skipped.

---

## Dependencies

- `customtkinter`, `PIL`, `mysql.connector`, `smtplib`, `win32com.client`, `tkinter`, `atexit`, `subprocess`, `platform`, `threading`, `json`, `os`, `shutil`, `datetime`, `random`, `urllib.request`, `winreg`.

---

## Limitations

- Only three backup databases are supported at a time.
- Designed primarily for Windows environments.
- Assumes all required resource files (images, icons, templates) are present in the packaged EXE.
- Some features (e.g., registry, shortcut creation) are Windows-specific.

## Detailed Flow

### 1. **Startup and Backup Detection**
   - On launch, the script checks for up to three backup database folders.
   - If backups are found, a GUI is presented for preview, restoration, or deletion.
   - Corrupted backups are detected and flagged; only valid backups can be restored.

### 2. **Backup Restoration or New Setup**
   - If a backup is restored, the main database is replaced and a rollback copy is saved.
   - If the user opts for a new setup, the least-used or corrupted backup is deleted if all slots are full.

### 3. **Setup Wizard**
   - The user is guided through a multi-step GUI:
     - Welcome
     - Terms and Conditions
     - Product Key Activation
     - Manager Credential Setup
     - Email Verification (with code delivery and countdown)
     - Database Selection (SQLite3, MySQL, JSON)
     - MySQL Credential Collection and Connection Test
     - Final Review and Confirmation
     - Finish Setup (shortcuts, notifications, uninstall entry)

### 4. **Post-Setup Actions**
   - Shortcuts are created on the Desktop and Start Menu.
   - An uninstall entry is registered in the Windows registry.
   - Automated emails are sent to the developer and manager.
   - All setup data is saved to JSON files for persistence.

### 5. **Cleanup**
   - On exit, all log files are closed to prevent data loss.

## Advanced Notes

- **Threading** is used for long-running file operations (e.g., backup restoration, deletion) to keep the GUI responsive.
- **CustomTkinter** is used for all GUI elements, providing a modern look and feel.
- **Resource Management**: All loaded images are closed after use to prevent memory leaks.
- **Rollback Safety**: Every backup restoration saves a rollback copy in a dedicated folder.
- **Extensibility**: The setup process is modular, allowing for future enhancements (e.g., more database types, advanced backup management).
- **Logging**: All significant actions and errors are logged for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

    - **Widget** (`CTk.CTkButton` or `CTk.CTkLabel`): The widget whose text will display the countdown.
    - **Count** (`int`): The starting value for the countdown in seconds.
    - **text_after** (`str`): The text to display on the widget after the countdown finishes.

    ### Functionality
    - Updates the widget's text to show the remaining seconds.
    - Decrements the count every second using the widget's `.after()` method.
    - When the countdown reaches zero, resets the widget's text to `text_after` and enables the widget if it was disabled.

    ### Returns
    - **None**

    ### Example Usage
    ```python
    __timer__(ResendButton, 10, "Resend Code")
    ```

    ### Notes
    - This function is designed for use with CustomTkinter widgets.
    - Commonly used to prevent immediate resending of verification codes or similar actions.

    ### Dependencies
    - Requires `customtkinter` (imported as `CTk`).

def register_uninstall_entry_user_scope() -> None:
    """<!-- Doc Strings -->
    ### Purpose
    Registers an uninstall entry for the "Bank-With-High-Functionalities" application in the Windows registry under the current user scope.
        This enables the application to appear in the "Add or Remove Programs" list for the current user, allowing for standard uninstallation via Windows settings.

    ### Functionality
    - Creates or updates a registry key at:
    > `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Bank-With-High-Functionalities`
    - Sets multiple registry values to provide Windows with all necessary information for displaying and uninstalling the application:
        - **DisplayName**: The name shown in the uninstall list.
        - **DisplayVersion**: The current version of the application.
        - **Publisher**: The application's publisher (developer).
        - **InstallLocation**: The directory where the application is installed.
        - **UninstallString**: The command to execute for uninstalling the application.
        - **DisplayIcon**: The icon shown in the uninstall list.

    ### Returns
    - **None**

    ### Example Usage
    ```python
    register_uninstall_entry_user_scope()
    ```

    ### Notes
    - This function should be called during the installation or setup process to ensure the application can be uninstalled via Windows settings.
    - The uninstall entry is created only for the current user (not system-wide).
    - Uses the `winreg` module for registry operations and relies on global variables such as `SETUPDATA`, `PATH`, `webpage`, and `github` for registry values.
    - The uninstall string typically points to an `uninstall.exe` in the application directory.

    ### Error Handling
    - If any error occurs during registry operations (e.g., permission issues, missing values), the error is caught and logged to the setup log file (`SETUP_LOGS`).
    - The function does not raise exceptions to the caller; all errors are handled internally.

    ### Security
    - Modifies the Windows registry only for the current user, so no administrator privileges are required.
    - Does not affect other users on the system.

    ### Limitations
    - Only works on Windows operating systems.
    - Does not create a system-wide uninstall entry (for all users).
    - If the registry cannot be written (e.g., due to permissions), the uninstall entry will not be created.

    ### Dependencies
    - Requires the `winreg` module for registry access.
    - Relies on global variables for application metadata and paths.

# To Check The Presence Of Previous Backup Database
class CheckForBackupDatabase:
    """<!-- Doc Strings -->
    ## Purpose
    The `CheckForBackupDatabase` class manages the detection, validation, restoration, deletion, and organization of backup database folders for the "Bank-With-High-Functionalities" application. It provides both backend logic and a graphical interface for users to interact with available backups, ensuring data integrity and smooth recovery or migration processes.

    ## Features
    - **Detection**: Identifies the presence of up to three backup database folders on the user's system.
    - **Corruption Check**: Validates each backup by attempting to load its initialization JSON file, marking corrupted backups and logging errors.
    - **Data Retrieval**: Extracts and stores initialization data and calculates the size of each backup for display and management.
    - **Graphical Management UI**: Presents a CustomTkinter-based window for users to preview, restore, or delete backups, and to toggle password visibility.
    - **Restoration**: Allows users to restore any valid backup, replacing the current database and saving a rollback copy for safety.
    - **Deletion**: Enables deletion of any backup (especially corrupted or least-used ones) to free up space or resolve issues.
    - **Automatic Cleanup**: Provides logic to automatically delete the backup with the fewest users or any corrupted backup when creating a new database.
    - **Folder Renaming**: Maintains a consistent and sequential naming convention for backup folders after any change.
    - **Integration**: Designed to be called at application startup to manage backup state before proceeding with setup or normal operation.

    ## Attributes
    - `isNewDatabaseRequested` (bool): Indicates if the user has requested to create a new database, triggering automatic cleanup if needed.
    - `Total_DBs` (list[bool]): Tracks the availability of each backup database.
    - `Database_01_init_Data`, `Database_02_init_Data`, `Database_03_init_Data` (dict): Store initialization data for each backup.
    - `isDatabase_01_Corrupted`, `isDatabase_02_Corrupted`, `isDatabase_03_Corrupted` (bool): Flags indicating if a backup is corrupted.
    - `isDatabase_01_Available`, `isDatabase_02_Available`, `isDatabase_03_Available` (bool): Flags indicating if a backup is available.
    - `DB_01_SIZE`, `DB_02_SIZE`, `DB_03_SIZE` (float): Sizes of each backup database in kilobytes.
    - `showpassword_DB_01`, `showpassword_DB_02`, `showpassword_DB_03` (bool): Flags for password visibility in the UI.

    ## Main Methods

    ### 1. `Check_Presence_Of_Database() -> bool`
    Checks if any backup database folders exist and updates availability flags. Returns `True` if at least one backup is present.

    ### 2. `Check_For_Corrupted_Databases_And_Retrieve_Data() -> None`
    Attempts to load initialization data from each backup and marks corrupted backups. Updates internal state for UI and logic.

    ### 3. `Restore_Database(Database_Number: int) -> None`
    Restores the selected backup database (1, 2, or 3), replacing the current database and saving a rollback copy. Runs in a separate thread for UI responsiveness.

    ### 4. `Restore_Backup_Database_Setup() -> None`
    Opens a GUI for users to preview, restore, or delete backups, and to proceed with creating a new database if needed. Handles all user interactions for backup management.

    ### 5. `Auto_Delete_Database_With_min_Users() -> None`
    Automatically deletes the backup with the fewest users or any corrupted backup to free up space when all slots are full.

    ### 6. `Rename_Folders() -> None`
    Renames backup folders to maintain sequential naming (e.g., BACKUP - DATABASE 01, 02, 03) after deletion or restoration.

    ### 7. `_exec_func_() -> None`
    Handles post-restore/setup actions such as creating shortcuts and registering uninstall entries.

    ## Example Usage
    ```python
    backup_checker = CheckForBackupDatabase()
    if backup_checker.Check_Presence_Of_Database():
        backup_checker.Restore_Backup_Database_Setup()
    ```

    ## Notes
    - Designed for use at application startup to manage backup databases before proceeding with setup or normal operation.
    - Integrates with CustomTkinter for GUI operations and uses threading for non-blocking file operations.
    - Handles up to three backup databases, maintaining their order and integrity.
    - Relies on global variables for paths, icons, and logs.

    ## Error Handling
    - Corrupted backups are detected and flagged; errors are logged to the error log file.
    - All file operations are wrapped in try/except blocks to prevent crashes and ensure smooth user experience.

    ## Security
    - Deletion and restoration actions are irreversible; users are prompted for confirmation.
    - Passwords are masked in the UI by default and can only be revealed on user action.
    - Sensitive data is not exposed in logs or UI unless explicitly requested by the user.

    ## Limitations
    - Only supports up to three backup databases.
    - Assumes required directories and resources exist and are accessible.
    - Designed for Windows file system conventions and may require adaptation for other OSes.

    ## Dependencies
    - Requires `os`, `shutil`, `json`, `threading`, and `customtkinter`.
    - Relies on global variables for resource paths, icons, and logs.
    - Uses `tkinter.messagebox` for user prompts and notifications.

        - This function should be called before displaying or restoring backup databases to ensure only valid data is used.
        - The function updates internal state flags (`isDatabase_01_Corrupted`, etc.) for use in the UI and logic.
        - Errors are logged to the `ERROR_LOGS` file for troubleshooting.

        ### Error Handling
        - If a database's initialization file is missing or unreadable, the corresponding `isDatabase_X_Corrupted` flag is set to `True`.
        - Errors are written to the error log file.

        ### Dependencies
        - Requires the `os`, `json`, and `Folder_Size` utility for file operations and size calculation.

        ### Purpose
        Restores the selected backup database (1, 2, or 3) to the application's main database directory, replacing any existing database. This is used when a user chooses to recover a previous backup.

        ### Parameters
        - **Database_Number** (`int`): The backup database number to restore (1, 2, or 3).

        ### Functionality
        - Removes the current main database and backup database directories.
        - Copies the selected backup database folder to both a rollback location and the main database directory.
        - Renames the backup folder to the standard backup directory name.
        - Notifies the user upon successful restoration.
        - Runs the restoration process in a separate thread for each database to keep the UI responsive.
        - Shows a progress/info message during the restoration process.

        ### Example Usage
        ```python
        self.Restore_Database(1)  # Restores Backup Database 1
        self.Restore_Database(2)  # Restores Backup Database 2
        self.Restore_Database(3)  # Restores Backup Database 3
        ```

        ### Notes
        - This function is intended to be called from the backup database restore setup window.
        - The restoration process is performed asynchronously using threads.
        - A rollback copy of the backup is saved in the user's local app data for safety.

        ### GUI Integration
        - Hides the backup database window during restoration.
        - Displays message boxes to inform the user about the restoration status and warnings.

        ### Security
        - Overwrites existing database files and directories. Use with caution.
        - Always creates a rollback copy before replacing the main database.

        ### Limitations
        - Only works if the backup folders exist and are accessible.
        - User should not exit or force stop the application during restoration to avoid data corruption.

    def Restore_Backup_Database_Setup(self) -> None:
        """<!-- Doc Strings -->
        ### Purpose
        Opens a graphical interface for users to view, preview, restore, or delete available backup databases. This method is invoked when backup databases are detected, allowing users to manage them before proceeding with a new setup or restoration.

        ### Functionality
        - Scans for up to three backup databases and checks their integrity.
        - Displays a CustomTkinter window listing all detected backups, showing details such as manager name, user count, backup size, and corruption status.
        - Allows users to:
                - Preview detailed information for each backup (manager credentials, security code, email, timestamps, etc.).
                - Restore a selected backup, replacing the current database and saving a rollback copy.
                - Delete any backup database, with confirmation and immediate UI update.
                - Toggle password visibility for each backup using an eye icon.
        - Provides a guide panel explaining icons and actions, and tips for troubleshooting.
        - Offers a button to proceed by creating a new database, which will automatically delete the backup with the fewest users or a corrupted one if all slots are full.

        ### Parameters
        - **self**: Instance of the `CheckForBackupDatabase` class.

        ### Returns
        - **None**

        ### Example Usage
        ```python
        backup_checker = CheckForBackupDatabase()
        backup_checker.Restore_Backup_Database_Setup()
        ```

        ### Notes
        - This method is typically called at application startup if backup folders are found.
        - The UI is built using CustomTkinter and is modal, blocking further setup until a decision is made.
        - Only valid (non-corrupted) backups can be restored; corrupted ones can only be deleted.
        - The method updates internal state flags for backup availability and corruption status.
        - Deleting or restoring a backup updates the UI in real time and may trigger folder renaming for sequential order.

        ### GUI Integration
        - Provides a user-friendly interface for managing backup databases.
        - Integrates with other methods for restoring and deleting backups, and for toggling password visibility.

        ### Security
        - Restoring a backup will overwrite the current database and backup folders; this is irreversible.
        - Deleting a backup is permanent and cannot be undone.
        - Passwords are masked by default and can be revealed only on user action.

        ### Limitations
        - Supports a maximum of three backup databases.
        - Assumes all required icon/image resources are available and loaded.
        - If a backup is corrupted, it cannot be restored but can be deleted.
        - The method assumes the presence of certain global variables and resources (e.g., icon images, CustomTkinter widgets).

        ### Dependencies
        - Requires `customtkinter` for the UI.
        - Relies on other methods in the class for restoring and deleting backups.
        - Uses `os`, `shutil`, `threading`, and `tkinter.messagebox` for file operations and dialogs.

        def Show_Hide_Manager_Password(DB_Number: int) -> None:
            """
            ### Purpose
            Toggles the visibility of the manager's password field for a specific backup database in the restore backup database setup window.

            ### Parameters
            - **DB_Number** (`int`): The database number (1, 2, or 3) indicating which manager password field to show or hide.

            ### Functionality
            - If the password is currently hidden (masked), it will be shown in plain text and the eye icon will change to a "hide" icon.
            - If the password is currently visible, it will be masked again and the eye icon will change to a "show" icon.
            - Updates the corresponding state variable (`showpassword_DB_01`, `showpassword_DB_02`, or `showpassword_DB_03`) for each database.

            ### Example Usage
            ```python
            Show_Hide_Manager_Password(1)  # Toggles visibility for Database 1 password
            Show_Hide_Manager_Password(2)  # Toggles visibility for Database 2 password
            Show_Hide_Manager_Password(3)  # Toggles visibility for Database 3 password
            ```

            ### Notes
            - This function is intended for use within the Restore_Backup_Database_Setup method.
            - The function relies on the existence of password entry widgets and eye button widgets for each database.

            ### GUI Integration
            - Changes the `show` property of the password entry widget.
            - Changes the image of the eye button to indicate the current state (show/hide).

                """<!-- Doc Strings -->
                ### Purpose
                Destroys (removes) all child widgets from the backup database frames in the restore backup database setup window. This is typically used to clear the UI before updating or reordering the displayed backup databases.

                ### Functionality
                - Iterates through all child widgets of the up and down frames for each backup database (DB_01, DB_02, DB_03).
                - Calls `.destroy()` on each widget to remove it from the GUI.

                ### Parameters
                - **None**: This function does not take any parameters.

                ### Returns
                - **None**

                ### Example Usage
                ```python
                Remove_Widgets()  # Clears all widgets from the backup database frames before refreshing the layout
                ```

                ### Notes
                - Intended for internal use within the `Orderly_Place_Backup_Databases_Selection` function.
                - Helps ensure that the frames are empty before repopulating them with updated content.
                - Prevents widget duplication and layout issues when the backup database selection UI is refreshed.

                ### GUI Integration
                - Directly affects the visual state of the backup database frames in the restore backup database setup window.

        ### Purpose
        Automatically deletes the backup database with the minimum number of active users among all available and non-corrupted backup databases.

        ### Functionality
        - Checks if all three backup databases are available.
        - Determines which backup database (1, 2, or 3) has the lowest number of active users.
        - Deletes the backup database folder with the minimum users using a background thread.
        - If a database is corrupted, it is deleted immediately in a separate thread.

        ### Parameters
        - **self**: The instance of the `CheckForBackupDatabase` class.

        ### Returns
        - **None**

        ### Example Usage
        ```python
        backup_checker = CheckForBackupDatabase()
        backup_checker.Auto_Delete_Database_With_min_Users()
        ```

        ### Notes
        - This method is intended to be used for automatic cleanup when storage or backup management is required.
        - The deletion is performed asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread.
        - Only operates if all three backup databases are present.

        ### Error Handling
        - If a database is corrupted, it is deleted without considering the user count.
        - If no eligible database is found, the method exits without action.

        ### Dependencies
        - Requires the `shutil` and `threading` modules for file operations and background processing.

        ### Security
        - Deletion is irreversible. Use with caution to avoid accidental data loss.

    def Rename_Folders(self) -> None:
        """<!-- Doc Strings -->
        ### Purpose
        Renames backup database folders to maintain a consistent and sequential naming convention after a database restore or deletion.

        ### Functionality
        - Checks if the database restoration process has completed.
        - Verifies the presence of backup database folders.
        - Renames backup folders so that the available databases are always named in order (e.g., BACKUP - DATABASE 01, BACKUP - DATABASE 02, etc.).
        - Ensures there are no gaps in the backup database numbering after deletion or restoration.

        ### Parameters
        - **self**: The instance of the `CheckForBackupDatabase` class.

        ### Returns
        - **None**

        ### Example Usage
        ```python
        backup_checker = CheckForBackupDatabase()
        backup_checker.Rename_Folders()
        ```

        ### Notes
        - This method should be called after any operation that may change the number or order of backup database folders.
        - The method only performs renaming if the restoration/deletion process has been completed).

        ### Error Handling
        - If the restoration process has not been completed, the method exits without making changes.
        - Assumes that the folders exist and are accessible; errors during renaming are not explicitly handled.

        ### Dependencies
        - Requires the `os` module for file and directory operations.

        ### Security
        - Renaming folders may affect backup management. Use with caution to avoid confusion or data loss.

        ## Purpose
        Handles post-backup-restore or post-setup actions for the Bank-With-High-Functionalities application. This method is responsible for creating application shortcuts, registering uninstall information, and performing any finalization steps after a backup database is restored or a new setup is completed.

        ## Functionality
        - **Registers Uninstall Entry**: Adds an uninstall entry for the application in the Windows registry under the current user scope, allowing standard uninstallation via Windows settings.
        - **Creates Start Menu Shortcut**: Generates a shortcut to the application in the Windows Start Menu's Programs folder.
        - **Creates Desktop Shortcut**: Generates a shortcut to the application on the user's Desktop.

        ## Parameters
        - **self**: Instance of the `CheckForBackupDatabase` class.

        ## Returns
        - **None**

        ## Example Usage
        ```python
        backup_checker = CheckForBackupDatabase()
        backup_checker._exec_func_()
        ```

        ## Notes
        - This method is typically called after restoring a backup or completing a new setup to ensure the application is properly registered and accessible.
        - The method uses Windows-specific APIs and will only work on Windows systems.
        - Shortcuts point to the application's `main.exe` and use the official icon.

        ## Error Handling
        - If any error occurs during shortcut creation or registry operations, the error is logged to the setup log file (`SETUP_LOGS`).
        - The method does not raise exceptions to the caller; all errors are handled internally.

        ## Security
        - Modifies the Windows registry and file system only for the current user.
        - No sensitive data is exposed or handled by this method.

        ## Limitations
        - Only works on Windows operating systems.
        - Assumes the application directory and required files exist and are accessible.

        ## Dependencies
        - Requires the `os` module for path operations.
        - Requires `win32com.client.Dispatch` for shortcut creation.
        - Requires the `register_uninstall_entry_user_scope` utility for registry operations.

# Email Verification For Manager
class Manager_Email_Verification:
    """<!-- Doc Strings -->
    ## Purpose
    The `Manager_Email_Verification` class is responsible for handling the email verification process for the manager during the setup phase. It generates a unique verification code, sends it to the manager's email address, and provides functionality to resend the email if needed.

    ## Attributes
    - **ReceiverMailAddress**: The email address of the manager to which the verification email will be sent.

    ## Methods

    ### 1. `__init__(self, ReceiverMailAddress: str = SETUPDATA['Manager Email']) -> None`
    - **Purpose**: Initializes the `Manager_Email_Verification` class with the manager's email address.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `ReceiverMailAddress` (str): The email address of the manager. Defaults to the value in `SETUPDATA['Manager Email']`.
    - **Return Type**: None

    ### 2. `Send_Gmail(self) -> str`
    - **Purpose**: Sends a verification email to the manager's email address with a unique verification code.
    - **Process**:
      1. Generates a unique verification code.
      2. Creates an HTML email template with the verification code.
      3. Sends the email using the SMTP protocol.
    - **Return Type**: str
      - Returns `'Error Free'` if the email is sent successfully.
      - Returns `'Credentials Error'` if there is an issue with the email credentials.
      - Returns `'No Internet'` if there is no internet connection.
    - **Security**:
      - The manager's email app password is securely used to authenticate the SMTP session.
      - The verification code is embedded in the email but not stored permanently.

    ### 3. `Resend_Gmail(self) -> None`
    - **Purpose**: Resends the verification email to the manager's email address.
    - **Process**: Calls the `Send_Gmail` method to resend the email.
    - **Return Type**: None

    ## Example Usage
    ```python
    # Initialize the email verification class
    email_verification = Manager_Email_Verification(ReceiverMailAddress="manager@example.com")

    # Send the verification email
    result = email_verification.Send_Gmail()
    print(result)  # Output: 'Error Free' or an error message

    # Resend the verification email
    email_verification.Resend_Gmail()
    ```

    ## Notes
    - Ensure that the `SETUPDATA['Manager Email']` and `SETUPDATA['Manager Email App Password']` are correctly configured before using this class.
    - The email template is designed to be responsive and visually appealing.

    ## Example Email Template
    ```
    Subject: [Code] Is Your Verification Code To Access Your Manager Account.
    Body:
    Hi [Manager Name],

    Were excited to have you on board! To finish setting up your account and ensure your security, please verify your email address by using the verification code below:

    [Code]

    This code will expire in 10 minutes. If it does, you can request a new one.

    Best Regards,
    Bank-With-High-Functionalities Team
    ```

    ## Dependencies
    - Requires the `smtplib` module for sending emails.
    - Requires the `email.message.EmailMessage` class for constructing the email.
    - Relies on the `random` and `randint` functions to generate the verification code.

    ## Security
    - The manager's email app password is not stored in plaintext and is only used during the SMTP session.
    - The verification code is temporary and expires after 10 minutes.

    ## Limitations
    - The email sending functionality depends on the availability of an internet connection.
    - If the email credentials are incorrect, the email will not be sent.

	# Setup Class

	## Purpose
	The `Setup` class is the core of the setup process for the "Bank-With-High-Functionalities" application. \
	It provides a step-by-step graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through the installation and \
	configuration of the software. This includes tasks such as accepting terms and conditions, activating \
	the software, setting up manager credentials, selecting a database, and reviewing the final configuration.

	## Features
	- **Welcome Screen**: Displays a greeting and starts the setup process.
	- **Terms and Conditions**: Allows users to review and accept the license agreement.
	- **Software Activation**: Validates the product key for activation.
	- **Manager Mode Setup**: Collects manager details such as name, username, password, and security code.
	- **Database Selection**: Enables users to choose between SQLite3, MySQL, or JSON as the database type.
	- **MySQL Setup**: Collects MySQL credentials and verifies the connection.
	- **Final Review**: Displays all collected data for user confirmation before completing the setup.

	## Attributes
	- `SecurityCodeRefreshed` (bool): Tracks whether the security code has been refreshed.
	- `isNameConditionSatisfied` (bool): Tracks whether the manager name meets the validation criteria.
	- `isUsernameConditionSatisfied` (bool): Tracks whether the manager username meets the validation criteria.
	- `isPasswordConditionSatisfied` (bool): Tracks whether the manager password meets the validation criteria.

	## Methods
	### 1. `__init__()`
	Initializes the `SetUp` class and its attributes.

	### 2. `__str__() -> str`
	Provides information about the GitHub repository and contribution guidelines.

	### 3. `SetupWindows() -> None`
	Manages the entire setup process by creating and navigating between different frames in the GUI. This includes:
	- Navigation between frames such as Welcome, Terms and Conditions, Software Activation, Manager Mode Setup, Gmail Verification, Database Selection, MySQL Setup, and Final Review.
	- Validation of user inputs at each step.
	- Updating the `SETUPDATA` dictionary with user-provided information.

	### 4. `Inject_Initialization_Data_Into_JSON_Files() -> None`
	Injects the collected setup data into a JSON file for future use.

	## Setup Process
	The setup process consists of the following steps:
	1. **Welcome Screen**:
	   - Displays a welcome message and a "Let's Get Started!" button to proceed to the next step.

	2. **Terms and Conditions**:
	   - Displays the license agreement.
	   - Requires the user to accept the terms before proceeding.

	3. **Software Activation**:
	   - Validates the product key entered by the user.
	   - Updates the activation status in the `SETUPDATA` dictionary.

	4. **Manager Mode Setup**:
	   - Collects manager details such as name, username, password, and security code.
	   - Validates the inputs and ensures all criteria are met.

	5. **Gmail Verification**:
	   - Placeholder for Gmail verification functionality.

	6. **Database Selection**:
	   - Allows the user to choose between SQLite3, MySQL, or JSON as the database type.
	   - Updates the `SETUPDATA` dictionary with the selected database type and paths.

	7. **MySQL Setup**:
	   - Collects MySQL credentials such as host, port, username, password, and charset.
	   - Verifies the connection to the MySQL server.

	8. **Final Review**:
	   - Displays all collected data for user confirmation.
	   - Allows the user to copy the data to the clipboard.

	## Usage
	```python
	setup = SetUp()
	setup.SetupWindows()
	```

            """ <!-- Doc Strings -->
			## Purpose
			The `GenerateSecurityCode` function generates a unique, secure code for the manager. This code is used as an additional layer of security \
			during the setup process. The generated code is displayed in the GUI and can be copied and saved by the user.

			## Functionality
			- Generates a random 18-character security code.
			- The code consists of a mix of:
			- Uppercase letters
			- Lowercase letters
			- Numbers
			- Updates the `ManagerSecurityCode` entry field in the GUI with the generated code.
			- Ensures that the security code is refreshed each time the function is called.

			## Parameters
			- **None**: This function does not take any parameters.

			## Return Type
			- **None**: This function does not return any value.

			## Process
			1. Sets the `SecurityCodeRefreshed` attribute to `True` to indicate that a new code has been generated.
			2. Clears the `ManagerSecurityCode` entry field in the GUI.
			3. Generates an 18-character random code using the `SEQUENCE` list.
			4. Inserts the generated code into the `ManagerSecurityCode` entry field.
			5. Sets the `ManagerSecurityCode` entry field to read-only to prevent manual edits.

			## Example Usage
			```python
			# Call the function to generate a new security code
			GenerateSecurityCode()
			```

			## Example Output
			The generated security code will look like this:
			
			> `4Hfi~x>kVW]ZOrh:<r`
			
			## Notes
			- The `SEQUENCE` list contains all possible characters that can be used in the security code.
			- The function ensures that the security code is always 18 characters long.
			- The `SecurityCodeRefreshed` attribute must be set to `True` before proceeding with the setup process.

			## Security
			- The generated security code is displayed in the GUI but is not stored permanently.
			- The code is designed to be complex and difficult to guess, enhancing security.

			## Dependencies
			- Requires the `choice` function from the `random` module to randomly select characters from the `SEQUENCE` list.

			## GUI Integration
			- Updates the `ManagerSecurityCode` entry field in the GUI.
			- Disables manual editing of the `ManagerSecurityCode` field after the code is generated.

			## Purpose
			The `_GetManagerData_` function is responsible for collecting and validating the manager's data entered during the setup process. It ensures that all required fields are filled, \
			the security code is refreshed, and the input criteria are satisfied before saving the data into the `SETUPDATA` dictionary.

			## Functionality
			- Retrieves the following manager details from the GUI:
			- Manager Name
			- Manager Username
			- Manager Password
			- Manager Security Code
			- Validates the collected data to ensure:
			1. All fields are filled.
			2. The security code has been refreshed.
			3. Input criteria for name, username, and password are satisfied.
			- Updates the `SETUPDATA` dictionary with the validated data.
			- Disables further editing of the fields after successful submission.

			## Parameters
			- **None**: This function does not take any parameters.

			## Return Type
			- **None**: This function does not return any value.

			## Process
			1. Retrieves data from the GUI fields.
			2. Checks if all fields are filled. If not, displays an error message.
			3. Verifies if the security code has been refreshed. If not, displays an error message.
			4. Ensures that the input criteria for name, username, and password are satisfied. If not, displays an error message.
			5. If all validations pass:
			- Updates the `SETUPDATA` dictionary with the collected data.
			- Disables the input fields to prevent further editing.
			- Enables the "Continue" button to proceed to the next step.

			## Example Usage
			```python
			# Call the function to collect and validate manager data
			_GetManagerData_()
			```

			## Example Output
			If all validations pass, the `SETUPDATA` dictionary is updated as follows:
			```python
			{
				"Manager Name": "Virati Akiranandhan Reddy",
				"Manager Username": "viratiaki53",
				"Manager Password": "securepassword",
				"Manager Security Code": "4Hfi~x>kVW]ZOrh:<r"
			}
			```

			## Notes
			- Ensure that the GUI fields for manager data are properly initialized before calling this function.
			- The function relies on the `SETUPDATA` dictionary to store the collected data.

			## Error Handling
			- Displays error messages in the GUI if:
			- Any required field is empty.
			- The security code has not been refreshed.
			- Input criteria for name, username, or password are not satisfied.

			## Security
			- The manager's password and security code are stored in the `SETUPDATA` dictionary. Ensure that this data is handled securely and not exposed to unauthorized users.

			## Dependencies
			- Relies on the `SETUPDATA` dictionary to store the collected data.
			- Requires the GUI fields for manager data to be properly initialized and accessible.

			## GUI Integration
			- Updates the GUI to disable input fields after successful submission.
			- Enables the "Continue" button to proceed to the next step.

			# Return_Setup_Log Function

			## Purpose
			The `Return_Setup_Log` function generates a detailed log of the setup process, summarizing all the key information \
			collected during the setup. This log is primarily used for review purposes and can be copied to the clipboard for reference.

			## Returns
			- **str**: A formatted string containing the following setup details:
			- Manager Name
			- Manager Username
			- Manager Password
			- Manager Security Code
			- Manager Email
			- Manager Email App Password (redacted for security)
			- Email Verification Status
			- Database Type
			- Current Application Version

			## Security
			- Sensitive information such as the manager's email app password is redacted to ensure confidentiality.
			- The log is designed to provide only the necessary details for review without exposing critical credentials.

			## Example Output
			```
			Manager Name: John Doe
			Manager Username: johndoe123
			Manager Password: john@doe
			Manager Security Code: '%^*^$&jg758fj^($&)'
			Manager Email: johndoe@example.com
			Manager Email App Password: The Information Has Been Redacted For Security And Confidentiality Purposes.
			isEmailVerified: True
			Database Type: SQLite3
			Current App Version: 0.0.1 - Alpha
			```

			## Usage
			This function is typically called during the final review step of the setup process to display or copy the setup log.

			## Notes
			- Ensure that the SETUPDATA dictionary is populated with valid data before calling this function.
			- The function relies on the SETUPDATA dictionary to retrieve the setup details.

			## Example Usage
			```python
			setup_log = Return_Setup_Log()
			print(setup_log)
			```

            ### Purpose
            Handles post-setup actions after the user completes the setup process for the Bank-With-High-Functionalities application.

            ### Functionality
            - Optionally creates a shortcut to the application on the user's Desktop.
            - Optionally sends an automated email notification to the developer about the new client registration.
            - Optionally launches the main application executable (`main.exe`).
            - Always creates a shortcut in the Windows Start Menu's Programs folder.

            ### Notes
            - The function uses three Boolean variables (`CREATE_SHORTCUT`, `OPEN_MAIN_EXE`, `OPEN_DOCUMENTATION_WEB`) to determine which actions to perform.
            - The function is intended to be called after setup data is saved and the setup window is closed.

            ### Dependencies
            - Requires the `os` module for path operations.
            - Requires `win32com.client.Dispatch` for shortcut creation.
            - Requires `subprocess` for launching executables.
            - Requires `smtplib`, `email.message.EmailMessage`, and `urllib.request.urlopen` for sending emails.

            ### Security
            - Ensure the `PATH` variable is trusted to avoid creating shortcuts or launching unintended executables.
            - Email credentials are used securely and not exposed in logs or messages.

            ### Limitations
            - If any action fails (e.g., shortcut creation, email sending, launching the executable), the error is silently ignored.
            - The function is designed for Windows environments.

                Creates a shortcut for the Bank-With-High-Functionalities application in the Windows Start Menu's Programs folder.

                ### Functionality
                - Uses the Windows Scripting Host (via `win32com.client.Dispatch`) to create a `.lnk` shortcut.
                - Sets the shortcut's target to the application's `main.exe`.
                - Configures the working directory, description, and icon for the shortcut.

            def Greet_Manager() -> None:

                ### Purpose
                Sends a personalized "Thank You" email to the manager after the setup process is successfully completed.

                ### Functionality
                - Generates an HTML-formatted email that welcomes the manager and confirms the successful completion of the setup.
                - The email includes a greeting, a thank you message, and links to the developer's social media and website.
                - Uses the manager's name from the `SETUPDATA` dictionary for personalization.
                - Sends the email using SMTP with SSL authentication.

                ### Parameters
                - **None**: This function does not take any parameters.

                ### Returns
                - **None**

                ### Example Usage
                ```python
                Greet_Manager()
                ```

                ### Notes
                - The manager's email address and app password must be set in `SETUPDATA`.
                - The email is sent in HTML format for better appearance and branding.
                - This function is typically called at the end of the setup process.

                ### Dependencies
                - Requires `smtplib` for sending emails.
                - Requires `email.message.EmailMessage` for constructing the email.
                - Uses the `SETUPDATA` dictionary for manager details.

                ### Security
                - Uses the manager's email and app password for SMTP authentication.
                - No sensitive data is included in the email content.

                ### Limitations
                - If the email credentials are incorrect or there is no internet connection, the email will not be sent.
                - Exceptions are logged but not shown to the user.

        ## Purpose
        The `Inject_Initialization_Data_Into_JSON_Files` function is responsible for saving the setup data into JSON files. This ensures that the collected initialization data is stored persistently for future use by the application.

        ## Functionality
        - Saves the setup data (`SETUPDATA`) into two JSON files:
        1. **Main Initialization File**: Located in the primary database directory.
        2. **Backup Initialization File**: Located in the backup database directory.
        - Adds a timestamp (`Downloaded On`) to the `SETUPDATA` dictionary to record when the data was saved.

        ## Parameters
        - **None**: This function does not take any parameters.

        ## Return Type
        - **None**: This function does not return any value.

        ## Process
        1. Updates the `Downloaded On` field in the `SETUPDATA` dictionary with the current date and time.
        2. Writes the updated `SETUPDATA` dictionary to:
        - `Initialization.json` in the main database directory.
        - `Initialization.json` in the backup database directory.

        ## Example Usage
        ```python
        setup = Setup()
        setup.Inject_Initialization_Data_Into_JSON_Files()
        ```

        ## Notes
        - Ensure that the `SETUPDATA` dictionary is populated with valid data before calling this function.
        - The file paths for the main and backup JSON files are hardcoded and must exist for the function to work correctly.
        - This function overwrites any existing data in the target JSON files.

        ## Example Output
        The following JSON structure is saved to the files:
        ```
        {
                "isActivated": true,
                "License Verification": "Passed",
                "Current Version": "0.0.1 - Alpha",

                "Manager Security Code": "%^*^$&jg758fj^($&)",
                "Manager Email": "johndoe@example.com",
                "Manager Email App Password": "********",
                "isEmailVerified": true,

                "Downloaded On": "15-May-2025 -- Thursday @ 10:30:00 AM",
                "DATABASE TYPE": "SQLite3",
                "DATABASE PATH": "path/to/database.sqlite3",
                "BACKUP DATABASE PATH": "path/to/database.sqlite3",

                "MySQL Credentials": {

                        "Host": "localhost",
                        "Port": 3306,
                        "Username": "root",
                        "Password": "********",
                        "Database": "Bank-With-High-Functionalities",
                        "Charset": "utf8mb4"

                }
        }
        ```

        ## Security
        - Sensitive information such as passwords is stored in the JSON files. Ensure that these files are secured and not accessible to unauthorized users.

        ## Dependencies
        - Requires the `json` module for serializing the `SETUPDATA` dictionary into JSON format.
        - Relies on the `datetime` module to generate the timestamp for the `Downloaded On` field.

        ## File Paths
        - **Main File**: `Bank_Package/DATABASE/JSON/ADMINISTRATIVE FILES/Initialization.json`
        - **Backup File**: `BACKUP - DATABASE/JSON/ADMINISTRATIVE FILES/Initialization.json`

def __atexit__() -> None:
    """<!-- Doc Strings -->
    ## Purpose
    The `__atexit__` function is a cleanup handler that is automatically called when the program is about to exit. It ensures that all open log files are properly closed and provides a simple confirmation message for debugging or logging purposes.

    ## Functionality
    - Closes the following log files if they are open:
        - `ERROR_LOGS`: Error log file for recording errors and exceptions.
        - `EMAIL_LOGS`: Log file for email-related events and errors.
        - `SETUP_LOGS`: Log file for setup and installation events.
    - Prints a message ("things going well") to indicate that the cleanup was successful.

    ## Usage
    This function is registered with Python's `atexit` module and is called automatically when the interpreter terminates, regardless of how the program exits (normal completion, error, or interruption).

    ## Example
    ```python
    import atexit

    def __atexit__():
        # ...cleanup code...
        pass

    atexit.register(__atexit__)
    ```

    ## Notes
    - This function should not be called directly; it is intended to be used as an exit handler.
    - Ensures that log files are not left open, which helps prevent data loss or file corruption.
    - The print statement is mainly for debugging and can be removed or replaced with a logging call if desired.

    ## Limitations
    - If any of the log file objects are already closed or not defined, an exception may occur unless handled elsewhere.
    - Only handles the closing of specific log files; other resources should be managed separately.

    ## Security
    - No sensitive data is handled or exposed by this function.
